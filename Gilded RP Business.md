## ðŸ”¹ Starting a Business

- **Application Submission:** Business applications must be sent to our Roles & Applications tab(https://discord.com/channels/737446331920023628/1003417113781870592/1384588523306356940). Please note that you must be a citizen of the area (USA, Guarma, Mexico) before submitting your application. Applications will have deadlines and are reviewed and voted on by Jr. Admin+ before accepting or rejecting.
- **Post-Application Acceptance:** If your business application is accepted, you will receive an acceptance message from the bot. A ticket will also be opened, which will include loan pricing and stipulations regarding set up.

## ðŸ”¹ Maintaining a Business

- Once your acceptance letter has been reviewed and saved:

### ðŸ”¹ Loan Payments
- First priority should be paying off your loan. Once paid off, you must wait 30 days after payment before receiving your first item.
    - Loans can be paid off in chunks. Please open a ticket once the funds are available.
    - After that, you must wait 90 days for your next free item.
    - Additionally, if you purchase more items past your free item, you are required to wait **120 days** for the next free item.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Business Collaborations

- Businesses collaborations will count towards a business' custom item.
    - Example: if you purchase a collaboration soda as a saloon, it would count towards your saloon's custom item and not the soda company.
    - The collaborating company must solely sell this item to the business who paid for the collaboration. If caught selling the item without permission, it can result in legal actions in character.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Custom Item Restrictions

We have only a few restrictions regarding items:
- No bags/containers that can hold items as they are buggy and are still being worked on.
- Price gouging is not allowed, and you will be pulled into a ticket if caught doing so. If the act is continued after being pulled into a ticket regarding it, you will be subjected to a harsher punishment.
    - Price gouging is when someone sells an item for way more than itâ€™s actually worth, especially compared to the cost of materials.
- You are allowed to make a similar item to another business; however, you may not include verbiage that indicates the item is "better" or language that insinuates competition.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Selling or Transferring a Business

- **Ownership Limit:** You are required to own your business for at least 90 days before a business is sold or transferred. As stated in the rules, if you sell/transfer your business before your 90 days, you will be blacklisted from owning another business.
    - If you sell your business, you are required to wait 30 days before applying for a new business.
- **Private Sale of Business:** Businesses have set prices that must be paid out to the predecessor. You may not over pay or under pay for the business, and you are required to submit documentation in a ticket.
- **Private Transfer of Business:** Transfers must be documented in a ticekt with the proper paperwork.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Repossession Rules

If a business is inactive, players are allowed to open a ticket and inquire about said business. If a business is inactive (with no player activity or inventory movement) for 30 days without an LOA notice, that business will be reposessed by the government and the owner will be blacklisted from owning a business for 90 days.

- If you will be inactive, please submit an LOA via ticket with a timeline. If you need to extend the length of your LOA, please open a follow up ticket.

If you have any questions regarding businesses, please submit a ticket.
